# Tavily Search Integration Analysis & Fixes

## üîç Current Status

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- Tavily API key is properly configured in Convex environment
- Search function `performTavilySearch` is implemented and deployed
- Search results are being passed to content generation
- MCP Tavily tool is working and returning detailed results

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Identified
1. **Incomplete Citations**: Search results contain data but citations in generated content are not complete
2. **Raw Content Underutilized**: The `raw_content` field from Tavily contains more detailed information but wasn't being used effectively
3. **Citation Format**: Generated content wasn't consistently including proper inline citations and Sources sections

## üîß Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Search Function (`convex/search.ts`)
```typescript
// Improved to better handle raw_content and fallbacks
return data.results.map((item: any): SearchResult => ({
  title: item.title || "Untitled",
  link: item.url || "",
  content: item.content || "",
  raw_content: item.raw_content || item.content || "", // Better fallback handling
  score: item.score || 0,
}));
```

### 2. Improved Content Generation Prompt (`src/services/contentGeneration.ts`)
- Enhanced search context formatting with clearer source separation
- Added explicit citation requirements in the prompt
- Prioritized raw_content when available and more detailed
- Added specific instructions for inline citations and Sources section

### 3. Better Search Result Processing
```typescript
// Use raw_content when it's more detailed than summary content
const contentToUse = (result.raw_content && result.raw_content.length > result.content.length) 
  ? result.raw_content 
  : result.content;
```

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. **Test Search Function Directly**:
   - Open Convex dashboard
   - Navigate to Functions ‚Üí search:performTavilySearch
   - Test with query: "AI policy framework 2025"
   - Verify results include all fields: title, link, content, raw_content, score

2. **Test Content Generation**:
   - Use the app to generate content with search enabled
   - Verify inline citations appear as `[Source Title](URL)`
   - Check that Sources section is included at the end
   - Confirm specific facts are attributed to sources

3. **Test Files Created**:
   - `test-search-integration.html` - Visual test interface
   - `test-convex-search.js` - Command line test helper
   - `test-tavily-search.js` - Direct API test (requires local TAVILY_API_KEY)

### Expected Results
- Search should return 3-5 relevant results
- Each result should have detailed raw_content for citations
- Generated content should include:
  - Inline citations: `[Source Title](URL)`
  - Sources section at the end
  - Specific facts with attribution
  - Current information from 2025

## üöÄ Verification Checklist

### Search Function
- [ ] TAVILY_API_KEY configured in Convex
- [ ] Function deployed to production
- [ ] Returns array of SearchResult objects
- [ ] raw_content field populated and detailed
- [ ] No API errors in Convex logs

### Content Generation
- [ ] Search results passed to content generation
- [ ] Inline citations present in generated content
- [ ] Sources section included at end
- [ ] Specific facts attributed to sources
- [ ] Current 2025 information included

### User Experience
- [ ] Citations are clickable links
- [ ] Sources section is complete and formatted
- [ ] Generated content references specific facts from search results
- [ ] No "no data" or empty citation issues

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If Search Returns No Results
1. Check TAVILY_API_KEY in Convex environment
2. Verify API key is valid and has credits
3. Check Convex function logs for errors
4. Test with simpler queries

### If Citations Are Incomplete
1. Verify search results contain raw_content
2. Check content generation prompt includes citation requirements
3. Ensure Sources section is being generated
4. Test with different content types

### If Content Lacks Current Information
1. Verify search is being called before content generation
2. Check that search results are being passed to AI model
3. Ensure prompt emphasizes using search results
4. Test with topics that should have recent information

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Deploy Updates**: Ensure all changes are deployed to production
2. **Test End-to-End**: Generate content and verify citations work
3. **Monitor Usage**: Check Convex logs for any search errors
4. **User Feedback**: Collect feedback on citation quality and completeness

## üîó Key Files Modified

- `convex/search.ts` - Enhanced search function
- `src/services/contentGeneration.ts` - Improved citation handling
- Created test files for verification

The Tavily search integration should now provide complete, properly cited content with detailed sources and current information from 2025.
